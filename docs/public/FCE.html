            <h1>Main contents of the subject</h1>
            <p>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering gives their students the knowledge that a Computer Engineering should have. For this, the subject has an academic and a professional perspective that equip the students with necessary information about maths and physics, while they also learn soft skills like leadership useful in their life and work. The subject take a look to the possibiblities of a Computer Engineer in the work field and their role in today's society.</p>
            <p>To facilitate the study of the content, the subject is divided in two parts. The first one consist on the theoretical knowledge that the students should achieve, and in the second part the students can improve their practical skills.</p>
            <p>For these reason the theoretical content take the first 3 blocks of the subject. The first block focus in the Computer Engineer during the past, present and future, and the importance of ethics in this career. In the second block, the principle content is the information and data, for example the way in which they are represented  through numeral systems and how this information is organized and categorized depending in it's structure. It treats concepts like databases, Big Data and the laws related to the data. In the third block, the content is center in the processing, management and representation of the information, learning about important information such as hardware, software, operating systems, netwotks and trends of applications and computer systems.</p>
            <p>The second part of the content is about web development, in this block, the students learn the basic concepts of html and develop their skills by creating their own website. This website should be related with the subjects concepts where they should write about a topic made in group before this block, or an own choose topic. The group topic is an activity of the subject in which the students can improve their communication, writing and oral skills working with their group and explaining their topic to their own classmates.</p>
            <h1>Objectives</h1>
            <p>The goals of the subject are the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the goals and value of a Computer Engineer in society that a student should have as an engineer</li>
                <li>Know the fundaments of the technological process through the technological history.</li>
                <li>Realize that proffesional jobs need a human component that work for the common good</li>
                <li>Have certain understandings of the areas of a Computer Engineer to interest in some of the paths of this proffesion</li>
                <li>Know basic knowledge of web development and the trends in data management and computing for preparing for the working field.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Learning Outcomes</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The students should be able to use the information related to the hardware and software use in the creation and use of a computer system during an explanation.</li>
                <li>They know the history of computer science and be able to understand the future trends.</li>
                <li>Know the mechanisms to represent and organize the information in a computer system.</li>
                <li>Know the basic concepts that a Computer Enginneer need such as hardware and software.</li>
                <li>Have the enough skills to develop  a web system.</li>
                <li>Acquire the basic skills needed for a computer project. Some of these skills are researching and communicative skills.</li>
            </ul>
