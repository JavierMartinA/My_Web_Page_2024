            <div class="title">Mus</div>
            <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
                <p>Mus is a very famous 4 player betting spanish cards game played in pairs. It is tipical from the North of Spain. The origin of this game is not clear, but there is a very expanded theory that the mus is a Basque game.</p>
                <p>This theory argues that some of the terms used on this game have their origin in euskera. For example, "mus" has a similarity with the euskera word "musu" that is defined as "beso", and beso is a signal on this card game used when one of the players has the best cards on his/her hands. Another example is the term "ordago", very similar to the euskera expression "hor dago" that is defined as "ahí está" and is used in the game to express that you are betting all the round.</p>
                <p>It is known that the game has existed for at least two hundred years. During these years the mus was a famous game played in taverns.  </p>
                <p>There are two types of mus: the 4 kings mus and the 8 kings mus. In the mus of 8 kings, the twos count as aces (pitos) and the threes count as kings. </p>
            <h2><strong>Terms</strong></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Envido: To bet two points. If you say "envido number", you bet the number of points you said in number.</li>
                    <li>Ordago: You bet all the points of the game.</li>
                    <li>Paso: It is used for not betting or declining a rival bet. If you decline a rival bet, the rival gains 1 point if he/she has said "envido", and if there was a bet before the rival bet, and you decline the rivals bet, the rivals gain the points of the bet that was in the game before they said their own bet.</li>
                    <li>Veo: Used to accept a rivals bet.</li>
                    <li>Mano: It is the person that follows the player who has distributed the cards.</li>
                </ul>    
            <h2><strong>How it functions</strong></h2>
                <p>The mus is played by four people who are divided in pairs, each person of a pair should sit in front of his mate, so he/she should have his rivals on the left and right. The person who shuffles the cards and distributes them changes in each game passing to the "mano".</p>
                <p>Mus is played at the best of 2 or 3 games, and in each round the pair winner should have 30 or 40 points. During each round the players have 4 cards on their hands, if they want to change any of them, they should say "mus" and if everyone says "mus", each player can decide which cards he/she wants to discartd. If someone wants to beggin the bets, he/she should said "corto" and in this case the bets beggin without changing any card. In the first round, the players that "mus" should pass the deck to the next players.</p>
                <p>The mus is usually played with the spanish deck and without the 8 and 9 cards.</p>
                <p>When the bets round beggins, it has 4 parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Big: In this part, the player with the higher cards wins, being the best the kings. If two players have a king, they must look to the second higher card, and if it has the same value, they look the third card, and so on.</li>
                    <li>Small: It's similar to the "Big" but the best cards are the lower value cards, being the ases.</li>
                    <li>Pairs: This round is only played by the players who have on their hands a double pair (duples), three cards with the same number (medias), or a pair (pareja). If two rival players have the same pair, medias or duples, the winner is the one who is near the "mano" in an anti-clockwise order.</li>
                    <li>Game: The cards in this part have different values, the figures count as 10, the ases count as ones, and the other numbers are counted in a normal way. The result of the sum of your cards should be between 31 and 40 to play this part. If you are inside this value, from the best one to the worst one the hierarchy is 31, 32, 40, 37, 36, 35, 34 and 33. If the four players can't enter these round, they go to "punto", where the winner is the person who is closer to or at 30, when you "envidar" in this round you beggin with a bet of 3 points. If the best sum of two players is the same and it is the higher of the table, it is applied the closest one to the "mano".</li> 
                </ol>
                <p>Additional points: If you win or anyone has played the pair part, you gain an extra point if you have pair, two point if you have medias and 3 points if you have duples. If you have won the game part, you gain 3 extra points if you have 31, and you gain 2 extra points if you have more.</p>
            <h2><strong>Signs</strong></h2>
                <p>These are signs that you can make to your pair, but these signs can be caught by the rivals, so be careful.</p>
