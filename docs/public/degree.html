            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <p>Informatic Engineering is a field with a huge potential and in constant evolution. To prepare for this evolution, the UFV university teaches their students how to manage the new technologies and how to adapt to the new technologies that will appear in the future. For this task, the degree focuses in the fundamentals of the main areas that give the students a global vision to have a better response for the demands of society. </p>
            <h1>Structure</h1>
            <p>In the first years, the degree focuses on the fundaments of maths and informatics like algebra or calculus, to later study more practical skills like web development or security.</p>
