            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <p>The Informatic Engineer is a field with a huge potential and a constant evolution. To prepare for this evolution, the UFV university teaches their students how to manage the new technologies and how adapt to the new technologies that will appear. For this task, the degree focus in the fundamentals of the principles areas that give the students a global vision to have a better response for the demands of society. </p>
            <h1>Structure</h1>
            <p>In the first years the degree focus in the fundaments of maths and informatic like algebra or calculus, for later study more practical skills like web development or security.</p>
