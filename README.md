- Added a better version of home.

## Problems during the development
- The point of the index list appeared in the left part of the window, so I need a lot of research for solving this problem.
- In the degree page, the tables didn't have a border predefined and the different tables weren't align, so I need a lot of time to repair these problems.
- I had a problem for aligning the containers, but I discover a way of solving it thanks to the ctrl+mayus+i in the website.
